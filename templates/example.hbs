{{#$c:highlight}}Note:{{/$c:highlight}}
Example events *technically* conform to the JSON schema
type and formatting rules, but may not be representative of what
real events look like.

If your schema only validates types and doesn't supply strict
formatting, then the example events may look strange (e.g. - dates
as strings without strict formats may produce invalid dates)
